# CTC Design Template

The single source of truth for the Christ Tamil Church website design system.
Every page — new or migrated — follows this template. It codifies the
leader-approved homepage direction (`src/pages/Home.tsx`, the `ctc-*` class
system) so the rest of the site can match it.

**When this document and the code disagree, the live homepage wins.** Update
this document, don't fork the design.

Companion documents:

- `docs/design-system/follow-the-light-motion.md` — spec for the homepage's
  pinned "Follow the Light" scroll animation (homepage-exclusive).

Stylesheet ownership:

- `src/styles.css` — canonical tokens, reset, global typography, and shared foundations.
- `src/styles/layout.css` — shipping navigation and footer.
- `src/pages/Home.css` — homepage-only hero, atmosphere, motion, and teaser sections.
- `src/pages/<Page>.css` — route-owned inner-page styling.
- `src/components/**/**.module.css` — component-scoped animation systems.

Run `node scripts/prune-global-css.mjs --all` to audit unreachable class
selectors. Review its report before using `--write`; visual regression checks
remain mandatory after removal.

## 1. Design intent

Warm editorial reverence — natural-light photography, generous whitespace,
serif authority, deep greens and brass gold on white and warm cream. Bright,
welcoming, spiritual, family-focused. Tamil identity named with pride.
Visitor-first: a first-time guest should find Sunday time, location, and
"I'm New" without scrolling on any landing surface.

Avoid:

- Corporate SaaS or dashboard aesthetics (dense card grids, cold greys).
- Old church-bulletin clutter (cramped layouts, competing CTAs).
- Dark page themes, neon effects, large saturated color blocks.
- Trend-chasing decoration that outshines the message.

## 2. Tokens

The canonical token block lives at the top of `src/styles.css` (`:root`,
lines ~3–85, labeled as the Christ Tamil Church design system). **That block is the code
source of truth** — never hardcode a hex that has a token, and never invent a
parallel palette. The working set:

| Token | Value | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `--ink` | `#10251b` | Headings, strongest text |
| `--primary` | `#153d2b` | Deep forest green — primary surfaces, footer accents |
| `--muted` | `#59635c` | Body copy (muted green-grey) |
| `--faint` | `#8a9183` | Meta, captions |
| `--green-deep` | `#6ba52c` | Accent green — accent words, icons, citations |
| `--light` | `#8dc63f` | Bright leaf green — dots, glints, rail accents |
| `--gold` | `#b99045` | Brass gold — eyebrows, small labels. A spice, never a flood |
| `--clay-dark` | `#96702f` | Bronze — primary CTA fill (white text) |
| `--sage` | `#edf3ea` | Sage band / inset panels |
| `--canvas` | `#faf6ea` | Warm cream band |
| `--line` | `rgba(16,37,27,0.10)` | Hairlines, card borders |
| `--shadow-card` | `0 16px 34px rgba(16,37,27,0.06)` | Card shadow — always green-tinted, never grey |
| `--radius-md` | `8px` | Cards, images |
| `--radius-pill` | `999px` | Buttons, badges, icon circles |
| `--ease-out` / `--ease-premium` | `cubic-bezier(0.2, 0.7, 0.2, 1)` | Signature easing, all motion |
| `--motion-fast/base/slow` | `160ms / 260ms / 520ms` | Transition durations |
| `--container` | `1200px` | Content width (narrow prose ~980px) |

Legacy aliases such as `--warm-band` remain only while old global page rules
are migrated. **Never extend them or use them in new code.** The homepage's
former `--ql-*` palette has been replaced by the canonical tokens above.

## 3. Color usage

- **Green leads.** Ink-green headings, deep-green primary surfaces, green
  accents. Shadows are green-tinted (`rgba(16,37,27,…)`).
- **Gold is a spice.** Eyebrows, tiny labels, thin rules, and the one bronze
  primary CTA per view. Never large gold fills or gold body text.
- **White is the stage.** White/warm-white dominate; sage (`#edf3ea`) and
  cream (`#faf6ea`) full-bleed bands break up long pages — content stays
  centered in the container inside each band.
- **Imagery is warm** — golden natural light, real congregation photos.
  Slight saturation bump on hover (`saturate(1.03–1.06)`); never cold or B&W.
- **Contrast is non-negotiable.** Body text ≥ 4.5:1 against its band. Small
  colored labels use the deep variants (`--primary`, `--clay-dark`), not the
  bright accents (`--light`, `--green-deep` are for large/decorative use).

## 4. Typography

| Role | Font | Recipe |
|---|---|---|
| Display / hero headline | Fraunces 300–600 | `clamp(3.8rem, 7.4vw, 7.65rem)` desktop, `clamp(3.2rem, 15vw, 5rem)` ≤620px; tight leading 0.94–1.05, `letter-spacing: -0.02…-0.035em` |
| Section headline (h2) | Fraunces 300–500 | `clamp(30px, 4.4vw, 56px)`, line-height ~1.04 |
| Body / UI / buttons | Space Grotesk 300–600 | 16–17px body, line-height 1.6; buttons use the stronger available weights |
| Eyebrow / kicker / cite | Space Grotesk or the `--font-mono` fallback stack | 11–12px, uppercase, `letter-spacing: .16–.24em`, color `--gold` (eyebrows) or `--green-deep` (citations) |
| Tamil display & Scripture | Noto Serif Tamil 300/400, italic 400 | Always `lang="ta"`, `letter-spacing: 0`, line-height ≥1.28 (vowel signs sit above and below). Size ~0.85× the Latin display size it replaces, since Tamil reads larger. **Upright = welcome/headline voice; italic = Scripture voice** (plus the one accent word). |
| Tamil UI labels | Catamaran 300–800 | Sentence case, minimal tracking; pair with an English small-caps reference badge (see hero kicker) |

Patterns:

- **Accent word:** the final/subject word of a display headline may be colored
  `--green-deep` (optionally italic Fraunces).
- **Tamil first:** where scripture leads a page, the Tamil phrase leads and the
  reference sits in a small pill badge (see `.ctc-hero-kicker`). Scripture
  quotes are Tamil (Noto Serif Tamil italic) with the English reference in
  the mono cite.
- Sentence case for body and headings; Title Case for ministry names.
  Uppercase only for mono eyebrows/labels.

## 5. Layout & rhythm

- Container `1200px`; narrow reading measure ~`980px` / `46ch` for prose.
- Section vertical rhythm `clamp(46px, 6vw, 82px)` padding inside bands;
  4px-based spacing scale.
- Long pages alternate: white → sage or cream band → white. One idea per band.
- One strong image per major section, registered in `src/data/images.ts`.
- Breakpoints in use (match them, don't invent new ones):
  - `1120px` — hero/two-column layouts collapse to one column.
  - `900px` — tablet adjustments, rail/decoration hides.
  - `620px` — phone layout; hero switches to the portrait crop image via
    `<picture><source media="(max-width: 620px)">`.

## 6. Component recipes

Concrete, shipping implementations to copy from. Homepage `ctc-*` recipes live
in `src/pages/Home.css`; shared foundations live in `src/styles.css`.

### 6.1 Page hero (`.ctc-hero-*`)

The homepage hero is the master pattern (see `src/pages/Home.tsx`):

1. **Kicker** (`.ctc-hero-kicker`): on the homepage, a small uppercase
   bronze (`--clay-dark`) eyebrow inside the H1, "Tamil Church in Chicago"
   (`heroKicker` in `src/data/site.ts`). It keeps the page's one H1 saying
   who and where in English while the Tamil headline changes weekly; don't
   remove it.
2. **Display headline** (`.ctc-hero-title`): on the homepage, Tamil-first in
   Noto Serif Tamil, two lines that never wrap. The first line leads in green
   italic at the same size as the second (it is long, so colour carries the
   emphasis); the second follows in light 300 ink. On phones the headline is
   sized so the first line fills the column. Inner pages use Fraunces, ink.
   The homepage wording is weekly content (see "Weekly homepage content"
   below), never hardcoded in `Home.tsx`.
3. **Lede** (`.ctc-hero-lede`): 1–2 sentences of visitor-focused copy. On the
   homepage each sentence is its own line ("Join us this Sunday." /
   "We'd love to welcome you and your family.") and never wraps.
4. **One primary CTA** — never a pair of competing buttons in a hero.
5. Optional full-bleed photo with a white wash gradient
   (`.ctc-hero-bg` + `.ctc-hero-bg-wash`) so text sits on calm space; on
   mobile the wash flips to top-down and a portrait crop serves via `<picture>`.
6. Optional info cards (see 6.3): on the homepage, the "Every Sunday" card
   and, while one is current, the featured event card.
7. Optional verse ribbon (`.ctc-hero-weekly-verse-ribbon`): the "Weekly Focus
   Verse" heading centred on its own line, the Tamil verse below, and the
   reference running on straight after the closing quote (inside the same
   paragraph, so it follows the last word). Phones set the reference on its
   own line under the verse.

**Homepage hero placement by screen.** Each element appears once per screen
size. Where it moves between layouts it is rendered in both places, and CSS
shows one (`display: none` also hides the other from screen readers).

| Screen | Copy column, under the lede | Over the photo |
|---|---|---|
| Desktop ≥1121px | Event card (slim, `.ctc-hero-notice`) | Lower-right corner: "Every Sunday" card above, "I'm New" below at the same width (220px), 12px apart |
| Tablet 621–1120px | Event card | Lower right: "Every Sunday" card above, "I'm New" below at the same width, 12px apart, lifted clear of the verse ribbon |
| Phone ≤620px | — | One stack: event card → "Every Sunday" card → "I'm New", 8–10px apart (twin cards, see 6.3) |

On phones the hero must still fit one screen with the verse visible, down to
360×640 and 375×560 (iPhone SE with Safari toolbars). Short screens
(≤700px tall) slim the cards rather than dropping content.

**Weekly homepage content.** Everything that changes week to week lives in
`src/data/site.ts`, so a weekly update never touches page code:

- `heroHeadline`: `firstLine` (green) and `secondLine`. Keep each line to
  about 30 characters, or the phone headline gets small.
- `verseOfTheWeek`: `label`, Tamil `text` and `reference`. Copy the verse from
  a Bible source such as tamilbiblesearch.com, never from memory. Verses over
  about 100 characters are set a step smaller on tablets and phones.
- `featuredEvent`: the event card and the /events featured band, or `null`
  for no event. It hides itself the day after `endsOn`. The flyer workflow is
  in [pages/events.md](pages/events.md).

Inner pages use a lighter variant: kicker + headline + lede + one CTA on a
white or cream band; the photo and info card are optional, the structure is not.

### 6.2 Buttons

Rounded **pill** is the sitewide button shape (`border-radius: var(--radius-pill)`).

- **Primary — bronze pill** (shipping as `.ctc-hero-actions a.go`):
  fill/border `--clay-dark` `#96702f`, text `#fff`, warm shadow
  `0 16px 38px rgba(150,112,47,0.38)`; hover deepens to `#7d5c26` with a
  `-2px` lift and a subtle white shimmer sweep (`a.go::before`).
  One bronze primary per view.
- **Secondary — quiet pill** (shipping as `.ctc-hero-actions a`):
  `rgba(255,255,255,0.86)` fill, `--line` hairline border, ink text;
  hover: lime-wash fill, green text, `-2px` lift.
- **Tertiary — arrow text link** (shipping as `.ctc-featured-directions` on
  the Events page): strong-weight Space Grotesk in `--clay-dark`, trailing
  `ArrowRight` (lucide) that slides `3px` on hover.
- **Round icon action** (shipping as `.ctc-hero-card a.ctc-hero-card-directions`,
  the map pin, and `.ctc-hero-card-event-go`, the event arrow): a 44px circle
  (40px on short phones) in `--sage` with a `--primary` icon; hover fills
  `--primary` with a white icon. Icon-only, so it always carries an accessible
  name (a `.sr-only` label such as "Get directions") and a `title` tooltip.
  Used for a card's single action where words would crowd it.

Buttons are `min-height: 52px` (44px+ touch target), Space Grotesk 500–600,
transitions 160–180ms with the signature easing.

### 6.3 Card (the "Every Sunday" look, `.ctc-hero-card`)

- Solid warm white `#fffefa`. No `backdrop-filter`: it is costly over the
  pinned homepage sequence (see the Follow the Light performance rules).
- Hairline border `rgba(16, 37, 27, 0.12–0.14)`: a visible edge, never
  white-on-white.
- Green-tinted shadow (`0 18px 50px rgba(16, 37, 27, 0.18)` floating over the
  photo on desktop); the softer `--shadow-card` when resting on a flat band.
- Radius `18px` for feature cards; `--radius-md` (8px) for in-flow cards.
- Anatomy: small uppercase label in `--primary` ("EVERY SUNDAY") over the
  value in ink (Fraunces "10:30 AM"), with a round icon action on the right
  (the map pin, see 6.2). The time never wraps.
- Hover (linked cards only): `-2…-3px` lift, border warms toward
  `rgba(21,61,43,0.22)`.

**Featured event card.** Its own card, never folded into the Sunday card.
Desktop and tablet (`.ctc-hero-notice`): a sage calendar icon tile, the label
"SUNDAY, OCT 11 · 10:30 AM" (weekday, short month and day, then time; no
"Featured Event" wording), the title on one line in `--font-serif-text`
(Newsreader 600), and a `--clay-dark` arrow on the right edge. It links to
`/events#featured`. It is a quiet card, never a second bronze button.

**Phone twin cards.** On phones the event card and the "Every Sunday" card
share one anatomy so they read as a set:

- Grid `44px · 1fr · 44px`: a sage leading tile (a calendar leaf with month
  over day for the event; a clock for Sunday), a small-caps label over a
  Newsreader value in the middle, and a round icon action (arrow; map pin).
- Same height (68px; 58px on screens ≤700px tall, 54px ≤600px), padding,
  radius, border and shadow. "I'm New" below matches their width and edges.
- Labels: "SUNDAY · 10:30 AM" / "EVERY SUNDAY". Values: the event title /
  "10:30 AM". Both values step down together on the narrowest phones so the
  title stays on one line.
- Screen readers hear the event as its title, full date and time, then
  "(event details)"; the leaf and label are `aria-hidden` duplicates.

### 6.4 Section header

Eyebrow + headline + optional one-sentence support text (component:
`src/components/SectionHeader.tsx`). Eyebrow is mono uppercase gold; bilingual
eyebrows use "English · தமிழ்" separated by a middot.

### 6.5 Row list (editorial ministry list, `.home-teaser-ministry-*`)

For "ways to belong"-style indexes: hairline-separated rows of
`index (mono gold) · lucide icon (green) · Fraunces title · muted meta`;
hover indents the row 12px and turns the title italic green. Prefer this over
card grids for lists of links.

### 6.6 Verse / pull-quote block (`.home-teaser-verse`)

Sage panel, italic Fraunces quote in ink `clamp(22px, 3vw, 30px)`, mono
uppercase citation in `--green-deep`. Scripture is quoted directly and cited
inline (e.g. `Matthew 11:28`).

### 6.7 Iconography

Lucide only (`lucide-react`), 2px stroke, 14–22px inline or 20–28px inside
42–52px green pill circles. No filled icons, no emoji, no unicode glyphs.

## 7. Motion

Gentle and reverent — light revealing the page, not decoration moving on it.

**Sitewide (every page):**

- Entrances: fade-up — opacity 0→1 + `translateY(14–28px)` → 0, 650–800ms,
  easing `cubic-bezier(0.2, 0.7, 0.2, 1)`, small stagger (~150ms) between
  siblings (see `heroFadeUp` / `heroImageIn` keyframes).
- Scroll reveals via `IntersectionObserver`, class-toggle only — never
  re-render React per scroll frame.
- Hovers: 160–260ms; lifts of `-2…-4px`; image scale ≤1.025 with a slight
  warm-up. No bounce, no springs, no infinite loops.
- `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` is mandatory: kill transforms/reveals and
  show content immediately (pattern: the `.flat` mode in
  `FollowTheLight.module.css` and the global reduced-motion block in
  `styles.css`). Anything that starts at `opacity: 0` and relies on its
  entrance animation to appear must also be forced visible
  (`opacity: 1 !important`) when motion is reduced. Turning the animation off
  is not enough: the homepage verse once stayed invisible that way.

**Homepage hero load sequence.** One sequence on every screen, in reading
order, so nothing pops in ahead of the text:

| Delay | Element |
|---|---|
| 260ms | Tamil headline |
| 360ms | Lede |
| 440–640ms | The cards and "I'm New", in reading order for that screen (event → Sunday → "I'm New" on every screen) |
| 620ms+ | Verse ribbon (rule, heading, then the verse with its reference) |

The Sunday card and "I'm New" sit inside elements pinned at
`opacity: 1 !important` for Follow the Light, so they fade with
`filter: opacity()` and move with `translate` (keyframes `heroCardIn`) rather
than `opacity`/`transform`. Use the same approach for any new element there.

**Homepage-exclusive atmosphere — do NOT copy to inner pages:**

- The left light-rail spine and scroll comet. (The particle canvas, cursor
  glow, vignette and grain were removed: Follow the Light's opaque pin
  covers them completely, so they only cost frame time.)
- The pinned "Follow the Light" scrollytelling
  (`src/components/FollowTheLight/`) — spec in
  `docs/design-system/follow-the-light-motion.md`.

Inner pages get the restrained sitewide subset only. If a future page earns a
signature moment, it must be planned deliberately, not pasted.

## 8. Imagery

- Every image is registered in `src/data/images.ts` (`SiteImage` type: src,
  alt, credit, usage, optional `objectPosition`). No ad-hoc `<img src>`.
- Warm, natural-light, human photography — congregation, families, welcome
  moments. Tamil community represented authentically.
- Decorative images: empty `alt=""` + `aria-hidden="true"` (see hero
  background). Content images: specific, human alt text.
- Lazy-load below-the-fold images (`loading="lazy"`); hero images load eagerly
  with explicit `width`/`height` to prevent layout shift.
- Responsive art direction via `<picture>` + `<source media>` matched to the
  CSS breakpoints (the hero's 620px portrait crop is the pattern).
- Unsplash images keep credit fields and the UTM referral params (see
  existing registry entries).

## 9. Voice & copy

- Second person to the visitor ("you and your family"); first-person plural
  for the church ("we'd love to welcome you").
- Warm, gentle, pastoral. Sincere about faith without being preachy;
  hospitality leads.
- Scripture quoted directly, cited inline with abbreviated book names.
- CTAs are gentle imperatives: "Plan your visit", "Get directions",
  "Ask for prayer".
- No emoji, no hype. Expand acronyms warmly (B.L.A.S.T. = Bible Learning And
  Spiritual Training). Name Tamil identity with pride.

## 10. Inner-page blueprint

Every inner page (Visit, Worship, Connect, Grow, Serve, Contact, …) follows
this skeleton:

```
<PageHero>        kicker · headline · lede · one primary CTA   (§6.1 light variant)
<Band × 2–4>      alternating white / sage / cream bands, each:
                  SectionHeader (§6.4) + ONE content pattern
                  (row list §6.5, cards §6.3, verse block §6.6, prose + image)
<ClosingBand>     visit/next-step CTA: address or relevant action,
                  bronze primary + tertiary links
```

Rules:

- Semantic HTML: one `h1` per page, sections labeled via
  `aria-labelledby`, landmarks intact. Keyboard focus visible.
- Sunday worship time, address, and a path to "I'm New"/Contact reachable
  from every page (hero CTA or closing band).
- Verify at desktop (1900), tablet (~900), and phone (487/380 wide) before
  calling a page done. Use browser screenshots and production builds; no
  Playwright test suite is currently configured in the repository.
- Keep page changes isolated and remove obsolete selectors only after source
  reachability and visual-regression checks.
- Each migrated page gets its own stylesheet (`src/pages/<Page>.css`) and a
  short design note in `docs/design-system/pages/`. Worked example:
  [Sunday School](pages/sunday-school.md).
