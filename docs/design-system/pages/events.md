# Page design: Events (`/events`)

Events is a standalone discovery page built from the shared `churchEvents` data. It combines the leader-approved homepage hero language with the event-discovery reference: a light split hero with bilingual kicker, large hospitality-led headline, and Sunday information card; then a centered “Upcoming at CTC” introduction and one spacious vertical list of horizontal image-and-copy event rows.

The page follows the CTC design template: green-led editorial typography, restrained brass labels, a bronze primary action, generous white space, warm photography, and page-scoped reveal motion. Event rows use a 16:9 image beside title, schedule, location, description, and action. At 620px the rows become intentionally stacked image-first stories, matching the reference’s mobile reading order.

The current data describes recurring schedules rather than dated calendar instances. For that reason, the page says “gatherings” and displays the supplied cadence/date language without implying chronological order. When church leadership adds exact dates, registration URLs, or event-specific alt text to the shared data model, the cards can surface them without changing the page structure.

## Featured event

One current event can be featured at a time: a quiet notice line under "I'm New" in the homepage hero links to a cream band at the top of this page (`/events#featured`) that shows the whole flyer.

**Changing it each week** (all names are generic; only values change):

1. `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/featured-flyer.ps1 "path\to\flyer.jpg"` writes the flyer into its fixed slot (`src/assets/images/featured-event-flyer.jpg`, an 800px copy for phones, and its pixel size).
2. Edit `featuredEvent` in `src/data/site.ts`: title, `startsOn`/`endsOn` (YYYY-MM-DD, Chicago dates), time, location, summary, and `flyerAlt` (what the flyer says, for screen readers).
3. No event this week: set `featuredEvent = null`. The hero and this page then look exactly as they do without the feature.

**Rules**

- The flyer is never cropped. Wide banners (3:1 and similar) span the band with the details below; portrait or square flyers sit beside the details.
- The flyer's text is unreadable on phones, so every fact (date, time, place, summary) is repeated as real text, and the flyer links to its full-size file.
- `flyer: null` shows a lettered poster (deep green, date block, Fraunces title) in the flyer's place; it is `aria-hidden` because the same facts follow as text.
- Homepage placement: the event is always its own card, separate from the "Every Sunday" card. Desktop (≥1121px): the event card sits alone under the welcome text, and the "Every Sunday" card and the bronze "I'm New" button sit together in the photo's lower-right corner (card above, button below at the same width, 12px apart). Tablets: the event card sits under "I'm New" and the Sunday card floats over the photo. Phones: under the welcome text the order is the event card, then the "Every Sunday" card, then the bronze "I'm New" button (8–10px apart); the event card and the "Every Sunday" card are matched twins: same height, padding, radius and shadow, each with a 44px sage tile on the left (calendar leaf for the event, clock for Sunday), a small-caps label over a Newsreader value ("SUNDAY · 10:30 AM" over the title; "EVERY SUNDAY" over "10:30 AM"), and a 44px round sage action on the right (arrow; map pin). "I'm New" matches their width. The event card label is the date and time ("SUNDAY, OCT 11 · 10:30 AM"), with no "Featured Event" text, and is never a bronze button. On short phones (≤700px tall, e.g. iPhone SE) both cards condense to one slim line each: "Every Sunday 10:30 AM", and an "OCT | 11" chip with a one-line title. The Sunday card reads "EVERY SUNDAY · 10:30 AM" with a round sage map-pin button for directions (named "Get directions" for screen readers) at every size.
- Expiry: an event disappears the day after `endsOn`. Prerendered pages judge this from the build date (`__BUILD_DATE__`), the browser re-checks the real date after load, and a daily scheduled deploy refreshes the static HTML.
